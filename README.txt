Problems 1 and 2. The array is called 'c' and the result of applying IT_ascii2num and TBB_ascii2num will be placed into 'r' and 'rtbb' (in that order).
Problem 3: the description of the method I used to count how many loops in one millisecond is inside the while loop in main. I found 255 loops per millisecond.
